#GameInfo 

A city requires 2 Food per citizen per turn to avoid starvation.

Food, like [[Production]], comes primarily from the *land*.

*Surplus* food (food produced past that which is required to not starve) is placed in the *City Growth Bucket*. When the buckets reaches a certain threshold, the city levels up, and a new citizen is born.

Note that when a *Settler* is being produced, they consume *all of the city's excess food production*!
