#GameInfo 

Production is the ability of cities to generate improvements and units.

Each city generates a certain number of *Production Points* (PP) every turn. PP are applied each turn to whichever project is in progress. Each project has a certain *total* number of PP that must be applied before it completes.

An unhappy city generates 2% less PP per point of *Unhappiness*. Conversely, during a *Golden Age*, all cities recieve a 20% production decrease.

The most important source of production is the *land*. Many terrain types offer *production potential* that is added to the city's total PP generation when *worked*.
