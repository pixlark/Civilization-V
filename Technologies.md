Here is a spreadsheet that maps how far into the tech tree each technology actually lies. The graphic presented in-game is misleading. For example:
 - *Fertilizer*, which opens the Industrial Era, can actually be reached in the same number of technologies as *Acoustics*, which opens the Renaissance Era.
 - Gunning it for *Radio* to enter the Modern era only takes four more techs than getting *Industrialization* and building three factories, so in most cases it's likely the much faster way of getting an Ideology.

Some other takeaways:
 - *Optics* (distance 3) is the fastest way to enter the Classical Era.
 - *Theology* (distance 6) is the fastest way to enter the Medieval Era.
 - *Gunpowder* (distance 14) is the fastest way to enter the Renaissance Era.
 - *Fertilizer* (distance 16) is the fastest way to enter the Industrial Era.
 - *Radio* (distance 34) is the fastest way to enter the Modern Era.
 - *Atomic Theory* (distance 45) is the fastest way to enter the Atomic Era.
 - *Satellites* (distance 51) is the fastest way to enter the Information Era.
