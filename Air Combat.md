Air units must be located at an *air base*. This means:
 - City
	 - Holds up to 6 air units, or 10 with an *Airport*
 - Aircraft Carrier
	 - Holds 2 air units (can increase via promotions)

From their base, an air unit can launch an attack within their *operative radius*.

While at a base, an air unit *cannot be attacked*. However, when they attack, it is considered a *melee* attack, and therefore they will recieve damage in the process.

**Air Strike** allows an air unit to attack a land unit, a naval unit, or a city within its *operative radius*.

Some units have the **Interception** ability, which triggers a bonus attack when a hostile air unit enters the *interception radius* of the intercepting unit. Only one interception can be done per unit per turn.
