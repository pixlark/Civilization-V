(Based mostly on things FilthyRobot says occasionally)

 - Pearls
	 - Pearls suck. The only thing they produce a lot of is gold, which just doesn't funnel into growth the same way food or production would.
 - Bananas
	 - Useful because they produce +3 Food without buliding any improvements.
	 - *Never* build plantations on bananas. Once you have a university, jungle tiles produce +2 Science, which is lost if you clear the jungle to build a plantation.
