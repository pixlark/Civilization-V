### Strengths and Weaknesses

 - Tradition
	 - What's it good at?
		 - Growth and Science oriented
		 - Centralized [[Production]]
			 - A few core cities with high production that can make wonders
		 - Will likely have three or four cities to start
		 - Good population means [[Specialists|Specialist Slots]] will be easy to keep filled.
		 - As the end-game approaches, Tradition simply surpasses Liberty in its ability to produce Science
	 - Why? Some big reasons:
		 - Landed Elite
			 - +10% Growth and +2 [[Food]] in the Capital
		 - Finisher
			 - +15% Growth in all cities, and a free Aqueduct in your first four cities
			 - Aqueduct doesn't require Engineering researched
	 - What does it suck at?
		 - Early/mid-game production
		 - Difficult to expand past four cities

 - Liberty
	 - What's it good at?
		 - Powerful in *early game*
		 - [[Production]] oriented - specifically *decentralized* Production
			 - In simple terms: Lots of hammers spread across a lot of cities, as opposed to a small amount of hammers concentrated more densely in fewer cities
			 - This is *bad* for producing buildings or wonders. However, it's very very good at building lots of *military units*.
		 - Good at Faith generation (Faith generation essentially scales per-city)
			 - Shrine, Temple, perhaps special building. More cities = more of these buildings
		 - Good at planting dense cities (more like 4 tiles apart than 6 or 8). Your borders and population do not grow very fast, so you're essentially planting cities just to work a few nearby tiles for a large portion of the game.
			 - Tend to prioritize founding near Hills to boost early production
		 - Great at snowballing early on and conquering lots and lots of land very quickly
	 - Why?
		 - Republic
			 - +1 Production in every City and +5% Production in cities when constructing Buildings
			 - Enables rapid expansion early on, because the more cities you build, the more overall hammers you're generating versus a Tradition player
		 - Collective Rule
			 - Speeds the training of Settlers by 50% in the Capital and a free Settler appears near the Capital.
			 - Extremely strong in the early game
