For singleplayer games, especially on higher difficulties, keep these factors in mind:

> - Ancient era wonders are almost irrelevant because you can't get them. The AI will almost certainly build them first; plans to get them almost cripple you longterm. 
> - Classic/Medieval wonders have similar drawbacks, BUT are sometimes buildable. You must rush for them but getting, say, Petra is possible on a good start if you move quick. 
> - All tourism Wonders become more valuable than listed here; Tourism wins ARE plausible vs AI. Most of those wonders become T3 to T4 - helpful but not gamechangers alone. 
> - Porcelain Tower is better because AI will still make research agreements with you. 
> - CN Tower is less bad if you've gotten a wide empire (implausibly wide for multiplayer). This is better the wider your empire is. 6FFA Quick Speed you'll never get large enough to make this any good, but in a vs. AI domination game this can be a lot of population, and a net happiness up combined with happiness policies and/or wonders. 
> - Neuschwanstein and Kremlin are less bad because you can more easily spare or steal your way over to Railroad tech for them. The science race is less critical.

## S Tier

- **Alhambra**
	- Requires: Chivalry
	- +1 [[Culture]], +20% Culture. New units from this city receive Drill I. Provides a free Castle.
	- *Pros*
		- Best or second-best wonder in the entire game
		- Lets you get quadruple-promoted units
		- Starts Paratroopers/XCOM with Blitz, meaning they can attack the turn they are deployed - **extremely** powerful.
	- *Cons*
		- Chivalry is a low-priority technology
- **Colossus**
	- Requires: Iron-working, on the coast
	- +1 [[Great People|Great Merchant Points]], +1 Culture, +5 GPT, +2 Gold for trade routes *to* this city, +1 Gold for owner of trade route. +1 Trade Route. Free Cargo Ship appears
	- *Pros*
		- +1 Trade route, Free Cargo Ship and +5 GPT are all amazing early-game bonuses
		- If you are on the coast, you should almost always build the Colossus
	- *Cons*
		- Great Merchant points suck because they compete with Great Scientists and Great Engineers.
- **Great Library**
	- Requires: Writing
	- 1 Free Technology. +2 Great Work of Writing slots. +3 Science, +1 Culture, +1 Great Scientists Points. Free Library.
	- *Pros*
		- One of the best wonders in the game.
		- +3 Science so early is something like a 30% bump.
		- Free tech can allow you to reach Mathematics or Currency before anyone else.
		- Great Scientists points so early is extremely powerful - very early Academy becomes possible.
- **Hanging Gardens**
	- Requires: Mathematics, Tradition
	- Free Garden. +6 Food, +1 Culture
	- *Pros*
		- +6 Food so early is a game-changer for population growth.
- **Hubble Space Telescope**
	- Requires: Satellites
	- 2 Free Great Scientists. Provides a free Spaceship factory. +25% Production when building Spaceship parts. +1 Great Scientist Points
	- Note: At this stage in the game you will *never* be hard-building Hubble, it will always be Great Engineered.
	- *Pros*
		- The only point to this is the 2 free Great Scientists.
		- Used to rush endgame techs and acquire Nukes, XCOM, Stealth, etc. for a game-ending war push.
- **Machu Picchu**
	- Requires: Guilds, Mountains within 2 tiles of the city
	- +5 GPT, +2 Faith, +1 Great Merchant Points. +25% Gold from City Connections
	- *Pros*
		- +25% Gold is the primary point here. *Huge* Gold boost for the Medieval Era.
	- *Cons*
		- Great Merchant Points suck
- **Notre Dame**
	- Requires: Physics
	- +10 Happiness, +4 Faith, +1 Great Merchant Points
	- *Pros*
		- This is really for the Happiness. +10 Happiness in the Medieval Era dramatically improves your ability to rapidly grow.
	- *Cons*
		- Great Merchant Points suck
- **Prora**
	- Requires: Flight, Autocracy, on the coast
	- +2 Happiness, +1 Happiness for every 2 Social Policies. Provides free Social Policy.
	- *Pros*
		- Averages to probably 8-10 Happiness.
		- Free Social Policy with Autocracy is very good.
		- Autocracy is military, late-era-war-focused. Happiness helps when annexing cities. Prevents you from having to take so many Happiness tenets in Autocracy.
	- *Cons*
		- Almost always have to Great Engineer it. In a non-Capital coastal city, the build time will be even worse - Engineer + a few turns.
- **Statue of Liberty**
	- Requires: Replaceable Parts, Freedom
	- +1 Culture, +1 Production for every Specialist in every City. 1 Free Social Policy.
	- *Pros*
		- One of the *primary* reasons to pick Freedom, which is otherwise quite a bit weaker than Autocracy and Order.
		- Replaceable Parts is one of the first Modern Era techs that you'll acquire anyways.
		- If you've played the game right, you'll probably have 6-12 Specialists in each city, which is an incredible amount of Production over an entire empire.
	- *Cons*
		- Taking Freedom and *not* getting Statue of Liberty is *extremely* bad.
- **Temple of Artemis**
	- Requires: Archery
	- +1 Culture, +1 Great Engineer Points, +10% Growth in all cities, +15% Production when building ranged units.
	- *Pros*
		- Unlike almost everything else in the game, Temple of Artemis modifies *total growth* rather than surplus growth. This makes the 10% bonus extremely powerful, especially so early in the game.
		- Great Engineer point so early is quite good.
		- +15% Production on ranged units is nothing to blink at either. Ranged units will be for most of the game your primary unit.
