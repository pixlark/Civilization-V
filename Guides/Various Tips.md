### FilthyRobot

 - *Never* build banana plantations. The science gain from bananas late-game is way better than what you get from having to clear jungle and build a plantation early-game.
 - "Culture late-game essentially directly translate to more science" (how?)
 - "Growth equates to Science"
	 - Why? Because almost all Science buildings either:
		 - Multiply the Science produced
		 - Add absolute science *based on Population*.

#### CarlsGuides

 - Focusing on [[Food]] is almost always a good idea
 - Early-Game [[Production]] Trick
     - Early on, choose *Production Focus* while manually locking all Citizen to Food tiles. When the City grows, the new citizen will automatically be set to a Production tile and contribute that toward the City's current build queue. This can shave a turn off from early constructions.
 - Early Research choices should be based on your available *resources*, so you can quickly boost happiness, growth, and expansion.
 - Try not to start with Piety - choose Tradition, Liberty or Honor instead.

#### Lewis (Xephos)

 - Goal is to establish four central cities, a national college, and prepare for the midgame.
 - New cities should be six tiles away from the capital.
 - When adjacent to an enemy unit, your unit moves more slowly.
 - Almost always start Tradition. Never go Liberty or Piety.
