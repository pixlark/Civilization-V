### Mechanics

Two ways to get an Ideology:

 1. Tech into Industrialization, find some Coal, and build three Factories in three different cities.
 2. Enter the Modern Era.

The first person to take an Ideology is given *two* free Tenets, the second person to take that same Ideology is given *one* free Tenet, and everybody afterwards gets *no* free Tenets. So being one of the first two people to an Ideology is very important.

*Ideological Pressure* comes from having a different Ideology than someone else. This affects the game in a few ways:
 - AI with different Ideologies from you will be more hostile
 - If another Civ has lots of [[Cultural Victory|influence]] over your Civ, but you don't have much influence over theirs, your citizens will begin to become unhappy with your Ideology.
	 - This is worsened if a different Ideology becomes the World Ideology via Congress.

### Big Picture Considerations

Something to note is that, because completing Rationalism is so incredibly important, you will almost *never* end up taking a Tier 3 Ideology. In general, you can plan to get around 3-5 Tenets total throughout the course of the game.

Two reasons to pick an Ideology:

 1. Sometimes you *must* pick an Ideology. 
	 - If you're about to be defeated, you may be forced to spec into Freedom to get Volunteer Army for 6 free units.
	 - Say the person with the vast majority of World Congress votes goes Freedom, but you wanted to go Order. Unfortunately, his ability to spread Freedom means you would experience crazy levels of Unhappiness for being a minority Ideology, so you're forced to pick Freedom instead.
	 - This isn't the end of the world! It's better than the alternative...
 2. In support of a grand strategy, see following sections.

#### Autocracy

Does four things well:
1. Unit purchasing
2. Happiness (good Happiness Wonder too)
3. Cultural Victory
4. Spying

Comes with [[FilthyRobot Wonders|Prora]], an extremely powerful Happiness wonder.

##### Tier 1 Tenets

 - *Elite Forces* is garbage, never take it.
 - ***Mobilization*** is the primary reason to go Autocracy
	 - Gold cost of purchasing units reduced by 33%
	 - Lets you stockpile Gold to burst out lots of a certain unit *right* after researching them (as opposed to production which will always take time / Great Engineers)
	 - Two other purchasing modifiers
		 - Commerce: *Mercantilism*, 25%
		 - Big Ben Wonder, 15%
	 - All three results in units being 40% of the original Gold cost, which is extremely powerful.
 - *United Front* is almost never useful.
 - ***Futurism***
	 - +250 Tourism with all known civs when a Great Writer, Artist, or Musician is born
	 - Useful for defending against Ideological pressure from other civilizations.
	 - Pretty much the only way to get a Cultural victory in multiplayer.
 - ***Industrial Espionage***
	 - Spies steal technologies at twice the normal rate
	 - Very good for catching up on tech if you've fallen behind
 - *Fortified Borders* is worthless.
 - *Universal Healthcare* is not great.

##### Tier 2 Tenets

 - ***Militarism***
	 - +2 Local Happiness from every Barracks, Armory and Military Academy
	 - The best single source of Happiness in the game.
 - *Lighning Warfare* is cool but almost never worth grabbing over the other tenets.
 - *Police State* is meh.
 - *Nationalism* is nice but probably never worth grabbing.
 - *Third Alternative* could be useful if you really need Strategic resources
 - ***Total War***
	 - +25% Production when building Military Units and new Military Units start with +15 Experience
	 - Alongside just a Barracks, Armory, and Military Academy, new units will all come out *triple-promoted*.

##### Tier 3 Tenets

 - *Cult of Personality*
	 - +50% Tourism to civilizations fighting a common enemy
	 - **Worthless** in multiplayer, but could be good in single-player.
 - *Gunboat Diplomacy*
	 - Gain 6 more Influence (at Standard speed) per turn with City-States you could demand tribute from. Your military forces are 50% more effective at intimidating city-states.
	 - Could be good, very unlikely to be taken over Clausewitz's Legacy however.
 - *Clausewitz's Legacy*
	 - Receieve a 25% attack bonus to all Military Units for the first 50 turns after this policy is adopted.
	 - Probably the best Tier 3, but still unlikely to be taken.

#### Freedom

Considerations:
- Terrible at Happiness. You need to have *great* Happiness generation outside of Ideology to be safe picking Freedom (unless of course it's the vastly primary Ideology)

If you're doing Freedom, it means pretty much one of two things:
 - You think you're gonna need Volunteer army
 - You're planning on a New Deal build
 - You want the Statue of Liberty

Comes with [[FilthyRobot Wonders|Statue of Liberty]], which is one of the greatest wonders in the game. One of the foremost reasons to get Freedom.
 - If you're planning on going Freedom, get a Great Engineer set up and ready to nab the Statue of Liberty instantly.

##### Tier 1 Tenets

 - *Avant-Garde*
	 - 25% increased Great People generation
	 - Decent
 - *Creative Expression* is completely worthless.
 - ***Civil Society***
	 - Specialists consume only half the normal amount of [[Food]]
	 - 1 food instead of 2 food for each Specialist.
	 - Probably the best tier 1 Tenet
 - *Covert Action* is pretty weak.
 - ***Capitalism***
	 - +1 Local Happiness for every Mint, Bank and Stock Exchange
	 - 1, 2, *maybe* 3 Happiness per city
	 - Only decent source of Happiness in Freedom
 - *Economic Union*
	 - +3 Gold from all your trade routes with other civilizations following the Freedom Ideology.
	 - Could be good in singleplayer, **worthless** in multiplayer.
 - *Universal Healthcare* not great.

##### Tier 2 Tenets

 - ***Volunteer Army***
	 - 6 units are maintenance free. Receive 6 Foreign Legion infantry units immediately.
	 - Best tenet in Freedom.
	 - Great for suddenly pushing in a war.
 - *Urbanization* worthless.
 - *Their Finest Hour* not great.
 - *Universal Suffrage*
	 - Specialists in Cities produce half the normal amount of Unhappiness. Golden Ages are 50% longer.
	 - Good Happiness boost, but you'll almost never grab it over other policies/tenets.
 - ***New Deal***
	 - Landmarks and Great Person improvements produce +4 of the appropriate yield.
	 - Good but only very situationally. Helps create extremely high centralized production (alongside wonders and Great Engineer buildings).
	 - Need *lots* of Great People buildings to be useful.
 - *Arsenal of Democracy*
	 - +15% Production when building Military Units. +15 Influence from gifting units to City-States.
	 - Pretty good for maintaining high diplomatic influence (note he specifically points out Germany and Portugal for this strategy).

##### Tier 3 Tenets

You will pretty much never grab these. Perhaps in singleplayer.

#### Order

##### Tier 1 Tenets

 - ***Hero of the People***
	 - 25% increased Great People generation
	 - Decent. Only pick up if you won't need the tier 1 happiness tenets.
 - ***Socialist Realism***
	 - +2 Local Happiness from Monuments
	 - 2 Happiness per city. Pretty good.
 - ***Skyscrapers***
	 - Gold cost of purchasing buildings reduced by 33%
	 - Pretty much *Mobilization* but for buildings. Decent, but situational.
	 - Can even do things like purchase Research Labs so that you're getting full Science benefit the instant you research it.
 - *Patriotic War* is pretty shit
 - *Double Agents*
	 - Spies are twice as likely to capture enemy spies attempting to steal a technology
	 - Probably not super worth it, but might be okay if you're way ahead in Science
 - ***Young Pioneers***
	 - +1 Local Happiness from every Workshop, Factory, and Solar/Nuclear/Hydro Plant
	 - Good Happiness bonus, although slightly more delayed than *Socialist Realism*
 - *Universal Healthcare* just not as good as the two other Happiness bonuses

##### Tier 2 Tenets

 - *Academy of Sciences* is not worth it. Get the tier 1 Happiness tenets instead.
 - *Party Leadership* is complete garbage.
 - *Resettlement* is absolutely entirely completely shit.
 - *Cultural Revolution*
	 - +34% Tourism to other Order civilizations.
	 - Singleplayer could be good, **worthless** in multiplayer.
 - ***Worker's Faculties***
	 - Factories increase a City's Science output by 25%. Build Factories in half the usual time.
	 - Extremely good.
		 - If you enter Ideologies through Radio, head back to Industrialization and build your Factories super quick.
		 - Take it when you're already at amazing Science and your Science lead will just explode and become unreal
 - ***Five-Year Plan***
	 - +2 Production per City and +1 Production for every Mine and Quarry
	 - Quite good.

##### Tier 3 Tenets

Just don't take them. They're not very good.
