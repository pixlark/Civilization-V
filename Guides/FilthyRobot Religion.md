### Pantheons

Two kinds of Pantheon: Faith generation to get an early religion, and bonuses that help early growth.

Only listing those he mentioned as standouts
 - Faith Generation
	 - Desert Folklore
		 - +1 Faith from Desert tiles
		 - Perhaps the best faith generation pantheon, because desert tiles (oasis, desert hills, etc) are actually going to be worked anyway.
	 - Earth Mother
		 - +1 Faith from Copper, Iron, and Salt resources
		 - Pretty good, especially if you have Salt
	 - One with Nature
		 - +4 Faith from Natural Wonders
		 - Fantastic (if you have a natural wonder, duh)
		 - Can pretty much guarantee you first religion if you have a faith-based natural wonder
	 - Religious Idols
		 - +1 Culture and +1 Faith for each Gold or Silver
	 - Stone Circles
		 - +2 Faith from Quarries
		 - Decent but a little slow, because stone is not a luxury, so quarries probably won't be built very early.
	 - Tears of the Gods
		 - +2 Faith for each Gems and Pearls resource
 - Early growth
	 - God of the Open Sky
		 - +1 Culture from Pastures
		 - (Pastures: Sheep, Cattle, Horses)
		 - Pastures are great food/production early-game, so the culture generation is a good bonus
	 - God-King
		 - +1 Culture, +1 Faith, +1 Gold, +1 Production, and +1 Science in your Capital
		 - A good default if you get an early pantheon and you don't have resources in your capital that point you towards an obvious resource pantheon
	 - Goddess of the Hunt
		 - +1 Food from Camps
	 - Messenger of the Gods
		 - +2 Science in cities with a City Connection
		 - Could be decent if you have *lots* and *lots* of cities early on
	 - Sun God
		 - +1 Food for each Banana, Citrus, and Wheat resource
		 - *Extremely* powerful, if you have the resources available

### Founder Beliefs
Anything unlisted is never worth getting.
 - Ceremonial Burial
	 - +1 Global Happiness for every two cities following this religion
	 - Situationally good, only if you can reliably get all of the cities
 - Tithe
	 - +1 Gold for every 4 followers of this religion
	 - Objectively the best founder belief
 - World Church
	 - +1 [[Culture]] for every 5 followers of this religion in other civilizations
	 - Second-best to Tithe

### Follower Beliefs
Anything unlisted is never worth getting.
 - Divine Inspiration
	 - Each World Wonder provides +2 Faith in city
	 - This is *all* wonders, not just natural wonders
	 - Obviously only worth getting if you have wonders
 - Pagodas
	 - Use [[Faith]] to purchase Mosques (+3 Faith, +2 Culture, +1 Happiness)
	 - Top-tier
 - Religious Center
	 - Temples provide +2 Happiness in cities with 5 followers
	 - Top-tier
 - Religious Community
	 - +1% [[Production]] for each follower (max +15%)
	 - Top-tier

### Enhancer Beliefs
Anything unlisted is never worth getting
 - Defender of the Faith
	 - +20% Combat Strength near friendly cities that Follow this religion
	 - Good if you spread your religion wide
 - Holy Order
	 - Missionaries and Inquisitors cost 30% less Faith
	 - Decent if you're actively doing Missionary spam - unlikely because it's usually better to save up Faith rather than aggressively spread.
 - Itinerant Preachers
	 - Religion spreads to cities 30% further away
	 - Within 10 tiles of a religious city causes passive religious pressure. This turns that 10 tiles into 13.
 - Messiah
	 - Prophets 25% stronger and earned with 25% less Faith
	 - Only relevant for the less Faith part. Good because Prophets should almost exclusively be used to create Holy Sites (long-term investment on Faith generation).
 - Religious Texts
	 - Religion spreads 25% faster (50% with Printing Press)
	 - Decent for same reason as Itinerant Preachers

### Reformation Beliefs
Anything unlisted is never worth getting
 - Jesuit Education
	 - May build Universities, Public Schools, and Research Labs with Faith
	 - Likely only useful in a wide game. Requires lots and lots of Faith.
	 - Warning that this also helps other civilizations!
 - Sacred Sites
	 - All buildings purchased with Faith provide 2 Tourism each
	 - Good mostly in wide empires
	 - Useless in multiplayer
 - To the Glory of God
	 - Use Faith to purchase any type of [[Great People|Great Person]] starting in the Industrial Era
	 - Best reformation belief and easiest to use
	 - Great for wide empires
		 - Because for Liberty specs it's harder to finish out Social Policy trees which are the other way to buy Great People with Faith.

### Religion Strategy

You should not always be spreading your religion!

Some questions to ask:
 - What's your opponent's Faith generation like?
	 - If they have *low* Faith generation, and you have *high* Faith generation, you're much more incentivized to spread your religion to them.
		 - Why? Because they will be far less able to *benefit* from having your religion.
 - Focus on *who benefits*
	 - If you took Religious Community and Religious Center, then you're giving your opponents free Production and Happiness. So don't spend your Faith actively proselytizing! Then you're spending money on *them* just as much as you are on *yourself*.

How does religion spread?
 - The city in which a religion is founded is a Holy City. *Any* city within 10 tiles of that city will receive 9 (on Quick speed) pressure per turn.
	 - It takes 100 pressure to convert one citizen to your religion.
	 - *Over half* of the citizens of a city must be converted to become a religious city.
 - If your religion is the major religion of a city, then new citizens are *born into* that religion.
 - So it is much, much easier to get a lot of followers when your religion is *first*, and much, much more difficult when someone else has gotten there first.
